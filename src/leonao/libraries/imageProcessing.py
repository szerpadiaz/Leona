# Image Processing
A function that watches a folder and reads new files as soon as they are there 
Then, continues the program

## Face Detection - triggered through a new file called "detect_face.jpg"
1. Read the image
2. Detect the face
3. Write the bounding box to a file called "results.txt"

## Sketch Creation
1. Read the image
2. Detect the face (done again here to be more robust for e.g. tests)
3. Create a sketch using the APDrawingGAN
4. Trace the lines using pypotrace
5. Save lines into pickled dictionary of lists into watchfolder
